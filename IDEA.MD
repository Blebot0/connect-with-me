# IDEA: Contact Management App for iOS

## Overview
An iOS app where users can set up contacts with their phone numbers or social media profiles linked. The app organizes contacts into user-defined buckets (e.g., "Work", "Ex-Work", "School", etc.) and allows tagging with hashtags (`#`) for easier search and integration.

## Key Features
1. **Contact Setup**:
    - Add phone numbers and social media links (e.g., Instagram, LinkedIn).
    - Option to edit or delete contact details.

2. **Buckets/Segments**:
    - Users can create custom buckets to organize contacts.
    - Examples: "Work", "Ex-Work", "School", "Friends", etc.

3. **Hashtag Integration**:
    - Add hashtags (`#`) to contacts for better categorization.
    - Example: A contact in the "Work" bucket can have hashtags like `#Manager`, `#TeamLead`.

4. **Search Functionality**:
    - Search contacts using bucket names or hashtags.
    - Example: Searching `#Manager` will display all contacts tagged with `#Manager`.

5. **User-Friendly Interface**:
    - Intuitive design for adding, editing, and organizing contacts.
    - Drag-and-drop functionality for moving contacts between buckets.

6. **Data Privacy**:
    - Secure storage of contact information.
    - Option to export or back up data.

## Potential Use Cases
- Networking: Quickly find contacts based on their roles or relationships.
- Personal Organization: Keep work and personal contacts separate.
- Event Planning: Use hashtags to group contacts for specific events.

## Future Enhancements
- Integration with iCloud for backup and sync.
- AI-powered suggestions for hashtags based on contact details.
- Cross-platform support for Android and web.

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: SwiftUI
- **Backend**: Firebase or AWS for storage
- **Search**: Custom search algorithms leveraging hashtags and buckets
